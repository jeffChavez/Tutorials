Here is a quick tutorial to get your class repository up and running: 
- Open up terminal
- Inside terminal, navigate to the folder you want the repository to be cloned into by using the `cd` command, for example `cd Documents/CodeFellows`
- Now that you are inside this folder, use the `git clone` command to clone the class repository, for example, `git clone https://github.com/codefellows/sea-b29-iOS.git`
- In the future if you want to update your repo to get the latest slides from lecture, use the `git pull` command while you are inside the sea-b29-iOS repository folder
- Be careful of any changes you make to the class repository, as you may not be able to use the git pull command if there are unstaged changes. You may have to discard them with the `git clean -f` command. This will discard all changes, then you can use git pull to update your repository.
